This needs to be done just once by your users. After that, whenever they run *downloader* or *update_all* they'll also be installing your updated files.

## Modifying README.md

After you have your own repository based on this template, a good idea would be to edit your `README.md` describing the content of your database and how to use it. That way users will learn about your Database and will integrate it into their MiSTer's easily.

Feel free to remove any reference to the original template there.
